Some quarters end with a stack of partially translated release notes. We stopped waiting for parity and instead publish the English version immediately with a transparent banner that explains when other locales will land. The MDX metadata flags that a Spanish copy is missing, so the blog index shows a fallback badge for Spanish readers.

## Start with the reader's job

We write every release as a job story. That frame clarifies the "why" for partners in Latin America who prefer context before tactics. An English-only page still helps because support teams can quote it during office hours and the fallback chip sets expectations.

## Offer evergreen links

While the translation backlog catches up, we include links to evergreen documentation. The docs rely on a docs-as-code repo where the Spanish sections often already exist, so readers can switch languages mid-read.<Footnote id="evergreen">Documentation inherits the same locale detection logic, so readers rarely hit a 404 while waiting for a translation.</Footnote>

## Announce the follow-up

Each post closes with a tiny roadmap letting people know when the Spanish version will appear. Sometimes that date slips, but communicating the target builds more trust than silently delaying the launch.
