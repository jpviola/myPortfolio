We thought rituals required synchronous time until we started documenting the story of each sprint in English and Spanish at once. The trick is to write the recap like a short newsletter that happens to contain the tasks, blockers, and the decision log. The bilingual layer pays off because leadership in Mexico City reads the same intent as the NYC product trio, and nobody waits for a translation cycle.<Footnote id="newsletter">We use the same MDX component you see here, which means writers add `Footnote` right inside the copy.</Footnote>

## Anchor small rituals

Teams routinely underestimate the value of small, repeatable prompts. We opened each sprint review with a shared paragraph in English, then copied the block to Spanish and asked the reviewer to adapt idioms. The practice kept tone human, let us reuse charts, and exposed nuance about how customers described the same friction with different verbs.<Footnote id="verbs">Literal translations flattened urgency. Swapping verbs reminded us to validate the emotional weight for each market.</Footnote>

## Track the translation backlog

MDX makes it easy to see when a translation is missing. Each post declares its locale, so our blog index renders a subtle badge when Spanish readers are still seeing the English source. That tiny UI affordance nudges us to finish the translation but keeps the content available when only one language exists.

## Footnotes double as context

Bilingual writing invites tiny cultural clarifications. Instead of cluttering the paragraphs, we tuck them inside custom footnotes. The component renders numbered references inline and a localized list at the end of the article, so nobody needs to scroll back and forth.
